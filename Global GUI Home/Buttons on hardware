The following buttons are required to be on the hardware

Distinct functionality buttons: (Total: 3)
==============================
- Power ON/OFF button (1)
  -------------------
    Must be distinct and unique from other buttons. We propose using Rockers switch as ON/OFF is intuitive instead of push button or click and hold button types.

- Volume UP/DOWN buttons (2)
  ----------------------
    Digital stepping up and down volume. Continuous pressing Volume DOWN will result in MUTE.

Generic buttons: (Total: 7)
===============

- Home button (1)
  -----------
    Pressing it will land in Global GUI homepage.

- Cancel/Back button (1)
  ------------------
    Will lead to previous page or exit current app.

- OK/Enter/Description/Menu button (1)
  --------------------------------
    Will read the detailed description of a label in Description mode.
    Will go to the next page of the selected setting.
    Will open the app.
    Will open the selected setting.
    Will confirm the value entered in settings for configuration.

- UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT (4)
  ------------------
    Will navigate in the app menu.
    Will navigate the settings menu.
    Will navigate the global GUI menu.
    Will navigate between options.
    Will increment or decrement options in individual settings.

Button proposals:
================
1. Do we need button for tutorial or help marked with a question mark '?' symbol?
2. Do we need a button to pause/play the sounds?
3. Do we need a separate button for Menu? Are we overloading the OK button too much?
